# Leap Saga
Leap Saga is a platformer game, where you, the player need to navigate to a portal to teleport between worlds. There are a total of 8 worlds; 1 title screen, 1 start and end of game, and 5 worlds of actual gameplay. Each of these worlds have hidden coins in them, where you must find in order to beat the game 100%, the easier goal simply beating all 5 main levels. The controls work with arrow keys and WASD + 'space' and 'shift'. There are test portals within the constructors of each world excluding the title screen (TitlePage) and the final world (FinalWorld). Simply remove the comment hiding these portals and there will be an easy passageway through worlds.
